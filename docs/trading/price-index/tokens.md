### Key Points to Understand:

- **What is the Tokens Cube?**  
  The **Tokens** cube provides chain-specific, aggregated price and volume data for individual tokens. This includes OHLC values, moving averages, and volume across **all pairs** the token is traded with.
- **Volume Section Explained:**

  - `Base`: Volume of the token itself (the token in question) for all pairs.
  - `Usd`: Total base volume converted to USD.

> Please ignore the other fields, they're for internal reference and will be removed later.

- **IsQuotedInUsd**:  
  A boolean indicating whether the OHLC and average prices are expressed in USD (`true`) or in the quote token's value (`false`).
- **Clarification on "Quote":**  
  The **Tokens** cube **does not show the specific quote tokens** used in each trade. Instead, it aggregates across all pairs the token is involved inâ€”regardless of which token acted as the quote in those trades.
- If you need **pair-level granularity** (i.e., to know exactly which token was the quote in a specific pair), use the **Pairs Cube** instead.
