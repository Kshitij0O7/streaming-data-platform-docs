# Polygon (MATIC) API Documentation

In this section we will see how to fetch data on different tokens, transactions, DEXs via APIs and Streams.

If you need help getting data on Polygon (MATIC),reach out to [support](https://t.me/Bloxy_info).

## What is Polygon (MATIC) API?

Bitquery Polygon (MATIC) APIs help you fetch onchain data by writing a graphQL query.

## What are capabilities of Bitquery Polygon (MATIC) API?

Bitquery Polygon (MATIC) APIs are very flexible, you can fetch trade, transaction, balance information for a period, for a specific wallet and join with other information.

## Difference between Polygon (MATIC) RPC and Bitquery Polygon (MATIC) API?

**Polygon (MATIC) RPC**

- JSON-RPC endpoint exposing raw on-chain state & transactions
- No built-in history or analyticsâ€”any indexing/aggregation you build or outsource
- Ideal for submitting transactions

**Bitquery Polygon (MATIC) API**

- GraphQL endpoint over pre-indexed, parsed Polygon (MATIC) data (token transfers, DEX trades, NFTs, etc.)
- Historical data, joins, aggregations & real-time subscriptions
- Great for real-time data and historical backtesting without running your own indexer

## Does Bitquery support Polygon (MATIC) Websocket and Polygon (MATIC) Webhooks?

Bitquery supports websocket and webhooks, you can convert most of the graphQL APIs into graphQL streams by changing the word `query` to `subscription`. You can monitor this data via a websocket. More and [code samples available here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/subscriptions/websockets/).
