# Monitoring Solana at Scale: Managing 100s of Addresses

This guide demonstrates how to monitor real-time token transfers and DEX trades for hundreds of blockchain addresses efficiently using WebSockets and Streamlit. Learn to dynamically track and display key transfer and trade details in a real-time dashboard.

## Monitoring 100s of Addresses on Solana Transfers in Real-Time

This section walks through how to track real-time Solana token transfers using a WebSocket connection and display sender, receiver, amount, and time in a dynamic Streamlit dashboard.

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

First, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas gql
```

Then, import the following libraries:

```python
import asyncio
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from gql import Client, gql
from gql.transport.websockets import WebsocketsTransport
```

Set your Bitquery API token:

```python
TOKEN = "your_bitquery_api_token"
```

### 2. Preparing the List of Addresses

Define the list of Solana addresses you want to monitor:

```python
addresses = [
    "7Ppgch9d4XRAygVNJP4bDkc7V6htYXGfghX4zzG9r4cH",
    "G6xptnrkj4bxg9H9ZyPzmAnNsGghSxZ7oBCL1KNKJUza",
    # Add more addresses here...
]
```

### 3. Creating the Transfer Subscription Query

The following function dynamically generates a GraphQL query to monitor token transfers for the specified addresses:

```python
def create_transfer_subscription_query():
    address_list = ', '.join(f'"{addr}"' for addr in addresses)
    return gql(f"""
   subscription {{
    Solana {{
        Transfers(
            where: {{
                Transfer: {{ Sender: {{ Address: {{ in: [ {address_list} ] }} }} }}
            }}
        ) {{
            Transfer {{
                Amount
                AmountInUSD
                Receiver {{
                    Address
                }}
                Sender {{
                    Address
                }}
                Currency {{
                    Symbol
                }}
            }}
        }}
    }}
}}
    """)
```

### 4. Monitoring Real-Time Transfers

The `monitor_transfers` function sets up a WebSocket connection and subscribes to real-time transfer data. The results are displayed in real-time using a Streamlit dashboard.

```python
async def monitor_transfers():
    transport = WebsocketsTransport(
        url=f"wss://streaming.bitquery.io/eap?token={TOKEN}",
        headers={"Sec-WebSocket-Protocol": "graphql-transport-ws"}
    )

    await transport.connect()
    print("Connected to WebSocket for transfer monitoring.")

    transfers_df = pd.DataFrame()

    # Set up Streamlit display for transfers
    st.title("Solana Transfer Monitoring Dashboard")
    table = st.empty()  # Initialize an empty Streamlit table

    try:
        query = create_transfer_subscription_query()
        async for result in transport.subscribe(query):
            if result.data:
                print("Transfer Data:", result.data)
                transfer_data = pd.json_normalize(result.data['Solana']['Transfers'])

                # Select only the relevant fields
                display_data = transfer_data[[
                    'Transfer.Sender.Address',
                    'Transfer.Receiver.Address',
                    'Transfer.Amount',
                    'Transfer.AmountInUSD',
                    'Transfer.Currency.Symbol'
                ]]

                transfers_df = pd.concat([transfers_df, display_data], ignore_index=True)

                # Update the Streamlit table with the new data
                with st.spinner('Updating data...'):
                    table.dataframe(transfers_df, use_container_width=True)

    except Exception as e:
        print("Error during transfer monitoring:", e)
    finally:
        await transport.close()
```

### 5. Running the Transfer Monitoring Dashboard

To run the real-time monitoring dashboard, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run your_script.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser, where you will see real-time updates of Solana transfers for the specified addresses.

### Output

This is how it will look.

## Scaling the Monitoring

-   Initial tests were conducted with 50 addresses, yielding fast response times.
    
-   Increased the number of addresses to 150, and the response speed remained consistent without any noticeable delay.
    
-   Further tested with over 500 addresses, and again, no visible latency was observed.
    
-   The response time remained relatively quick even as the number of addresses increased, demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of the system.

## Monitoring Solana DEX Trades for 100s of Addresses

This section explains how to monitor real-time DEXTrades on Solana, displaying buy/sell data, trade prices, and other relevant trade information for hundreds of addresses.

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas gql
```

Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import asyncio
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from gql import Client, gql
from gql.transport.websockets import WebsocketsTransport
```

Set your Bitquery API token:

```python
TOKEN = "your_bitquery_api_token"
```

### 2. Preparing the List of Addresses

Define the list of Solana addresses you want to monitor for DEX trades:

```python
addresses = [
    "5qrvgpvr55Eo7c5bBcwopdiQ6TpvceiRm42yjHTbtDvc",
    "FpCMFDFGYotvufJ7HrFHsWEiiQCGbkLCtwHiDnh7o28Q",
    # Add more addresses here...
]
```

### 3. Creating the DEXTrades Subscription Query

This function dynamically generates a GraphQL query to monitor DEX trades involving the specified addresses:

```python
def create_dex_trades_subscription_query():
    address_list = ', '.join(f'"{addr}"' for addr in addresses)
    return gql(f"""
        subscription {{
            Solana {{
                DEXTrades(where: {{Trade: {{Buy: {{Account: {{Address: {{in: [{address_list}]}}}}}}}}}}) {{
                    Trade {{
                        Dex {{
                            ProgramAddress
                            ProtocolName
                        }}
                        Buy {{
                            Amount
                            Account {{
                                Address
                            }}
                            Currency {{
                                Symbol
                                Name
                            }}
                            Price
                        }}
                        Sell {{
                            Account {{
                                Address
                            }}
